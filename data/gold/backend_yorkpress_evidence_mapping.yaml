      schema migrations are stated.

  - requirement: CODE_QUALITY_01
    status: partial
    evidence_ids: [E001, E002, E003]
    rationale: >
      Sustained backend work implies reasonable code quality,
      but no explicit standards, reviews, or tooling are cited.

  - requirement: TESTING_UNIT_01
    status: partial
    evidence_ids: [E003]
    rationale: >

  - requirement: SYSTEM_DESIGN_01
    status: partial
    evidence_ids: [E002]

    evidence_ids: []
    rationale: >
      No evidence of CI/CD pipelines, deployment workflows,
      or environment automation is present in resume.

  - requirement: CONTAINER_AWARE_01
    status: unsupported
    evidence_ids: []
    rationale: >
      Docker is explicitly required by the JD,
