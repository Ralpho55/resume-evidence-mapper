  - requirement: API_INTEGRATION_01
    status: supported
    evidence_ids: [E001, E002, E003]
    rationale: >
      Internship work involved integrating Odoo modules;
      senior project and Shoplite included REST API integration
      with external services and frontend clients.

  - requirement: BACKEND_LOGIC_01
    status: supported
    evidence_ids: [E001, E002, E003]
    rationale: >
      Backend logic implemented across internship and projects,
      including business rules, recommendation logic, and order flows.

  - requirement: DATA_MODELING_01
    status: supported
    evidence_ids: [E001, E002, E003]
    rationale: >
      Evidence shows structured data handling in Odoo,
      MongoDB schema design in Shoplite,
      and data modeling in the senior project.

  - requirement: CODE_QUALITY_01
    status: partial
    evidence_ids: [E001, E002, E003]
    rationale: >
      Code quality is implied through sustained backend work,
      but no explicit evidence of standards enforcement or reviews.

  - requirement: DEBUGGING_01
    status: supported
    evidence_ids: [E001]
    rationale: >
      Internship explicitly involved debugging and fixing issues
      in production-like systems.

  - requirement: MAINTENANCE_01
    status: supported
    evidence_ids: [E001]
    rationale: >
      Internship responsibilities included maintaining
      and improving existing systems.

  - requirement: DOCUMENTATION_01
    status: supported
    evidence_ids: [E002]
    rationale: >
      Senior project includes a 130+ page technical report
      documenting architecture, logic, and evaluation.

  - requirement: WEB_SECURITY_01
    status: partial
    evidence_ids: [E004]
    rationale: >
      Security knowledge inferred from coursework;
      no explicit implementation evidence in projects.

  - requirement: API_DESIGN_01
    status: partial
    evidence_ids: [E002, E003]
    rationale: >
      REST APIs were implemented, but no explicit design ownership
      or API specification artifacts are listed.

  - requirement: SQL_CORE_01
    status: partial
    evidence_ids: [E001, E004]
    rationale: >
      Relational database exposure exists via internship
      and coursework, but no explicit SQL-heavy project is listed.

  - requirement: TESTING_UNIT_01
    status: partial
    evidence_ids: [E003]
    rationale: >
      Shoplite project mentions unit and integration tests,
      but no quantified coverage or test depth is provided.

  - requirement: TESTING_INTEGRATION_01
    status: partial
    evidence_ids: [E003]
    rationale: >
      Integration testing implied through SSE and API testing,
      but not explicitly documented.

  - requirement: SYSTEM_DESIGN_01
    status: partial
    evidence_ids: [E002]
    rationale: >
      System architecture described in senior project report,
      but no evidence of large-scale or production architecture.

  - requirement: COLLABORATION_01
    status: supported
    evidence_ids: [E001, E002, E003]
    rationale: >
      Team-based internship and multi-person academic/applied
      projects demonstrate collaboration.

  - requirement: FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_01
    status: partial
    evidence_ids: [E002, E003]
    rationale: >
      Backend integration with frontend clients is evident,
      but frontend work itself is not claimed.
